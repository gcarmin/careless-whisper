# RPM post-install scriptlet for Careless Whisper (runs as root after unpack).
# Refreshes desktop + icon caches so the menu entry and tray icon appear
# immediately, without waiting for a relogin. Every step is guarded and the
# script always exits 0 so a missing helper never aborts the dnf transaction.

Careless Whisper installed.

  • Launch it from your application menu — it lives in the system tray.
  • On first run, pick and download a Whisper model in Settings.

Wayland note (KDE/GNOME): global hotkeys are limited under Wayland, so the
app listens on a per-user FIFO instead. Bind a custom shortcut to:

  echo toggle > ~/.local/share/careless-whisper/careless-whisper.sock

(The auth token is created automatically on first launch.)
